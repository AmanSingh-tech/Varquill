CASE: Wrongful Termination - Davis vs. MegaCorp Industries

LAWYER A (Davis - Plaintiff):
Sarah Davis was terminated from her position as Senior Marketing Manager at MegaCorp Industries on September 1, 2024, allegedly for "performance issues." However, the termination occurred just 2 weeks after she filed a formal complaint about gender discrimination and unequal pay. Ms. Davis has documentation showing she was paid 25% less than male colleagues in equivalent positions despite having superior performance reviews. Her termination was clearly retaliatory. We seek reinstatement, back pay, and $200,000 in damages for emotional distress and reputational harm.

Supporting Evidence:
- Performance reviews showing "exceeds expectations" for 3 consecutive years
- Pay stubs comparing her salary to male colleagues
- Email documentation of discrimination complaint dated August 15, 2024
- Witness statements from coworkers regarding unequal treatment
- Medical records documenting stress and anxiety following termination

LAWYER B (MegaCorp Industries - Defendant):
MegaCorp terminated Ms. Davis due to legitimate performance concerns that arose in Q2 2024, well before any discrimination complaint. Her team failed to meet three major project deadlines, resulting in $100,000 in lost revenue. Multiple client complaints were filed against her in July 2024. The pay differential reflects differences in experience, education, and market conditions when employees were hired. The timing of her complaint and termination is coincidental. MegaCorp has a strong anti-discrimination policy and track record.

Defense Documentation:
- Project failure reports from Q2 2024
- Client complaint records from July 2024
- Detailed explanation of pay structure based on hire date and credentials
- Performance improvement plan issued to Ms. Davis on July 30, 2024
- Company's published anti-discrimination policies and training records
- Evidence that 3 other managers (2 male, 1 female) were also terminated in September for performance issues
