CASE: Property Boundary Dispute - Johnson vs. Williams

LAWYER A (Johnson - Plaintiff):
My client, Mary Johnson, purchased property at 123 Oak Street in 2020. A recent survey revealed that the neighbor, Robert Williams, has been using 15 feet of my client's land for his garden and shed for the past 8 years. This encroachment has reduced my client's usable property by approximately 600 square feet, valued at $15,000. We demand removal of the structures and compensation for use of the land.

Evidence:
- Official property survey from licensed surveyor (2024)
- Property deed showing correct boundaries
- Photographs of encroaching structures
- Property tax records

LAWYER B (Williams - Defendant):
Mr. Williams has been maintaining and improving this land continuously for 8 years, well beyond the 7-year adverse possession requirement in this jurisdiction. The previous owner never objected, and Mr. Williams acted in good faith, believing the land was his based on the fence line that existed when he purchased his property in 2016. He has paid property taxes on the entire parcel including the disputed area. Under adverse possession laws, Mr. Williams has acquired legal title to this strip of land.

Defense:
- 8 years of continuous, open, and notorious possession
- Property tax receipts including disputed area
- Witness testimony from previous owner
- Photos showing fence line from 2016
- Good faith reliance on existing boundaries
